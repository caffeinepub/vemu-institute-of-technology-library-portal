# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Style the "SELECT SYSTEM ROLE" dropdown options on the Login page with a yellow background and black text to match the page's gold/yellow theme.

**Planned changes:**
- Update the SELECT SYSTEM ROLE dropdown's `<option>` elements in `LoginPage.tsx` to have a `#FFD700` yellow background and black text
- Ensure the closed/selected state of the dropdown also displays the yellow background with black text

**User-visible outcome:** When users open the role dropdown on the Login page, all options (including the placeholder) appear with a yellow background and black text, visually consistent with the rest of the form's yellow/gold styling.
