## Summary
**Goal:** Revert the entire VEMU Library Portal application to Version 8, discarding all changes from Version 9.

**Planned changes:**
- Restore all frontend source files to their Version 8 state
- Restore all backend Motoko code to its Version 8 state
- Restore all configuration files to their Version 8 state

**User-visible outcome:** The application behaves exactly as it did in Version 8, with all Version 9 changes fully removed.
