{
  "frontend/src/index.css": "Global styles with OKLCH color system for the deep navy/gold academic theme, custom font imports, light/dark mode CSS variable tokens, and reusable component utility classes — with opacity modifiers removed from `@apply` directives to fix the PostCSS build error.",
  "frontend/tailwind.config.js": "Tailwind configuration with darkMode class strategy, custom font families (heading/body), extended color palette (navy, gold, warm-white, success, warning), premium box shadows, and fade/slide animation keyframes.",
  "frontend/src/contexts/ThemeContext.tsx": "React context providing light/dark theme state with localStorage persistence, applying the 'dark' class to document root on toggle.",
  "frontend/src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx": "Authentication context with role-based state management; fixes the initial `isRoleLoading` value to be `false` when admin password login is already persisted in localStorage (preventing infinite loading on refresh), and `setAdminPasswordLogin` now immediately calls `setIsRoleLoading(false)` so the redirect fires synchronously after credentials are validated.",
  "frontend/src/hooks/useQueries.ts": "Complete React Query hooks for all backend operations; admin-only queries (`useGetAllUsers`, `useGetDashboardStats`, `useGetAllBorrowRecords`, `useGetActiveUserCount`, `useGetAllReservations`) now enable when either `!!identity` (Internet Identity) or `isAdminPasswordLogin` is true, fixing the blank data issue for password-based admin logins.",

  "frontend/src/components/ProfileSetupModal.tsx": "First-login modal collecting user name and email, with `open` prop made optional (defaults to `true`) to fix the TypeScript error when rendered without the prop.",
  "frontend/src/components/AnimatedCounter.tsx": "Reusable animated number counter using requestAnimationFrame with cubic ease-out, counting from 0 to a target value on mount.",
  "frontend/src/pages/LandingPage.tsx": "Public landing page with a hero section featuring an autoplaying muted looping background video (`library-hero-bg.mp4`) with a `useEffect` that explicitly calls `.play()` on mount (with a `canplay` listener fallback) to handle browser autoplay policies, a poster/background image fallback on error, dark overlay for text contrast, and all original content (VEMU heading, badge, CTA buttons, animated stats, features grid, bottom CTA) fully preserved above the video layer.",
  "frontend/src/pages/LoginPage.tsx": "Login page with Admin email/password and Internet Identity tabs; the redirect effect now checks `!isRoleLoading` for the admin password path (ensuring it fires only after the context has settled), and `isPasswordLoggingIn` is reset to `false` in the redirect effect before navigating to `/admin`.",
  "frontend/src/pages/SignUpPage.tsx": "Sign-up page mirroring login flow — triggers Internet Identity, fetches and persists role after authentication, then redirects based on role with step-by-step onboarding UI.",
  "frontend/src/components/BookCatalog.tsx": "Book catalog grid with search/category filter, borrow button per card (disabled when unavailable), loading skeletons, error state, and toast notifications; correctly consumes `useGetAllBooks` and shows \"Showing X of Y books\" count.",

  "frontend/src/components/admin/OverviewTab.tsx": "Admin overview with animated stat cards (total books, users, borrowed, overdue) and a live \"Members Currently Online\" card; uses `useGetDashboardStats` and `useGetActiveUserCount` with proper loading/error states.",
  "frontend/src/components/admin/AddBookModal.tsx": "Modal dialog for adding/editing books with form validation, file upload support (PDF/ePub) using ExternalBlob with progress tracking, and proper form reset on open — fixes the TypeScript error by explicitly typing `readFileAsBytes` to return `Promise<Uint8Array<ArrayBuffer>>` and casting the result accordingly.",
  "frontend/src/components/admin/ManageBooksTab.tsx": "Admin books management tab with search, Add Book button (always visible since the page is already admin-guarded), edit/delete actions per row, confirmation dialogs, and loading/empty states — the role check on the Add Book button has been removed since AdminDashboard already enforces admin-only access.",
  "frontend/src/components/admin/ManageUsersTab.tsx": "Admin users management table with search/filter, loading skeletons, error state with retry button, and a user count display; uses `useGetAllUsers` which now works for both II and password-based admin logins.",

  "frontend/src/components/ProtectedRoute.tsx": "Route guard that computes `isStillLoading` differently for admin password login vs Internet Identity — admin password login only waits for `isRoleLoading` (not `actorFetching` or `isInitializing`), preventing the loading spinner from hanging indefinitely when no II identity is present.",
  "frontend/src/App.tsx": "Main app component with TanStack Router, wrapping the entire app in `QueryClientProvider`, `ThemeProvider` (next-themes), `CustomThemeProvider`, and `AuthProvider`; defines all routes with role-based `ProtectedRoute` guards.",
