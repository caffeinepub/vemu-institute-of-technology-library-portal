  "summary": "The diff implements REQ-14 in frontend/src/pages/LandingPage.tsx. The video element is added with autoPlay, muted, loop, playsInline attributes, absolutely positioned with w-full h-full object-cover, a dark overlay between video and content, the correct source path /assets/generated/library-hero-bg.mp4, a poster fallback, and a useEffect to handle autoplay policies. All existing hero content is preserved above the video layer. The static asset file (library-hero-bg.mp4) is not explicitly shown as added in the diff, but the diff summary notes only LLM-readable files; binary files would not appear. All major requirements of REQ-14 appear satisfied.",
