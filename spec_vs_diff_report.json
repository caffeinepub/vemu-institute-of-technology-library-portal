There is no evidence of actual frontend source files, backend Motoko code, or configuration files being reverted to Version 8. The requirement calls for reverting the entire application (both frontend and backend) to Version 8 state, but the diff contains no changes to application source files.",

      "reason": "The diff only modifies project_state.json (a metadata file). No frontend source files (React components, CSS, etc.), backend Motoko files, or configuration files (e.g., dfx.json, package.json, webpack/vite config) were added, modified, or removed to reflect a revert to Version 8. There is no evidence that any Version 9 changes were actually reverted in the application code.",
