  "summary": "The diff modifies frontend/src/pages/LoginPage.tsx to implement a custom dropdown for the SELECT SYSTEM ROLE field. Based on the file summary, the open options list uses a yellow (#FFD700) background with black text (darker shade on hover/selected), which aligns with REQ-12. The closed/selected state uses the same inputStyle with yellow background and black text. The change appears scoped to the role dropdown only.",
